abstract = {AbstractIn traditional software engineering methodologies, software correctness isestablished through testing and progressive fault mitigation. Safety propertiesare established by demonstrating that a sufficiently large number of test casesfail to violate them.In contrast,formal verification methodspermit a systems design process wheredesired safety properties are stated outright in the system specification, andenforced by automated analysis tools. This is of particular interest in designingdistributed systems, where safety properties may be easy to formally defineand specify, yet hard to implement in practice.Despite this promise, the use of formal methods has largely been confinedto academia and certain classes of safety-critical systems. Recently, however,companies like Amazon and Microsoft have adopted formal verification toolsto verify distributed system designs.In this thesis, we present a formal specification of the Chord distributed hashtable protocol, using the TLA+specification language. We specify the protocolat a coarse level with a relaxed failure model, and then increase the granularityand introduce fail-stop failures, yielding a formal specification of Chord withasynchronous messaging and fault-tolerance mechanisms.We first model-check the specification under the constraint that no failuresoccur, and show that it satisfies critical safety properties. We then show that theintroduction of failures leads the specification to admit several behaviors whichbreak the safety properties Chord promises, potentially leading to permanentpartitions in the network and performance degradation.As part of this work, we provide an overview of formal verification methods; wediscuss certain formalisms and logics involved in modelling and proving algo-rithms, show potential advantages of applying formal methods to distributedsystems design, and identify barriers keeping formal methods from widespreaduse.},
