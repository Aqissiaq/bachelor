1. get thesis template
2. start writing

main hypothesis: hashmap is correct?

look at ivy (1 day)
is it different enough from formal proof to be interesting?

maybe implement hashmap, or generate with specs

read papers about formal verification, write a bit about each, yank for my text.

plan B: just theory I guess? hopefully not needed
