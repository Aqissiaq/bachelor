notes on "Formal verification: is it real enough?" by Yaron Wolfsthal and Rebecca M. Gott

Formal Verification (FV) is used to mean formal verification by model checking.

FV is described but not extensively used (2005)

Bugs discovered by FV are complementary to those discovered by simulation (testing)

FV can:
    1. Start early in the design process
    2. Cover ALL possibilities (except for state space explosion)
    3. Faster simulation

FV has a bad rep because it requires upfront investment, seems difficult, and testing is "good enough"

Recommendations (in industrial setting)
- scope early
- communication between implementation and FV team
