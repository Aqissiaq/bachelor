Introduction:
	begynn med hash tables, make that the red thread.
	concurrency tied in or moved later
	"scale better" - specify

	"this problem" which problem?

Method
	maybe move discussion of logics to method section

Scope
	correctness (not performance)
	limited by hardware for model checking

2.3 SO hashmap
	move introduction of hashmaps to intro
	at least the generic stuff (that 3rd paragraph)
	"this problem" again

3. Specification
	maybe rename chapter to just "specification" or "specification of split-order map"
	maybe move goal to intro/scope

	maybe enumerate parts of the spec and create subsections
	clarify distinction -> expose structure

Q: my learning vs useful stuff
	"Åsmund had lært seg TLA+" er et greit utbytte, men "Åsmund har lagd noe nyttig" er bedre
	bruk litt tid til å prøve denne uka
	skriv litt discussion om arbeidet så langt først
